# GUI Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The GUI has been reorganized to group animations and controls by type with folders and related parameters inside each type, making the interface more logical and easier to navigate.

## Changes Made

### 1. Animation Controls Reorganization

**Before:** All animation parameters were controlled by a single "Animation Type" selector (Movement, Rotation, Scale, Combined) and a "Size/Movement" toggle.

**After:** Animation parameters are now controlled by individual toggles and organized into logical subfolders:

#### Individual Animation Toggles (Top Level)
- **Movement Animation** - Enable/disable movement animations
- **Rotation Animation** - Enable/disable rotation animations  
- **Scale Animation** - Enable/disable scale animations

**Removed:** The old "Size/Movement" toggle has been removed since individual animation toggles provide better granular control.

#### Movement Animations Folder
- Amplitude control
- Division selector (♪)

#### Rotation Animations Folder  
- Amplitude control
- Division selector (♩)

#### Scale Animations Folder
- Amplitude control
- Division selector (♬)

#### Shape Cycling Folder
- Division selector (♩)
- Pattern selector
- Direction selector
- Synchronization selector
- Intensity control
- Trigger selector

#### Center Scaling Folder
- Enable toggle
- Intensity control
- Curve selector
- Radius control
- Direction selector
- Division selector (♬)
- Animation speed
- Animation type selector

### 2. Sphere Controls Reorganization

**Before:** All sphere parameters were in a flat structure.

**After:** Sphere parameters are now organized into logical subfolders:

#### Material Properties Folder
- Refraction Index
- Transparency
- Transmission
- Roughness
- Metalness

#### Clearcoat Properties Folder
- Intensity
- Smoothness

#### Environment & Effects Folder
- Environment Map Intensity
- Water Effect toggle
- Distortion Strength

#### Size Folder
- Scale

### 3. Lighting Controls Reorganization

**Before:** All lighting parameters were in a flat structure.

**After:** Lighting parameters are now organized into logical subfolders:

#### Ambient & Directional Folder
- Ambient Light intensity
- Directional Light intensity

#### Point Lights Folder
- Point Light 1 intensity
- Point Light 2 intensity

#### Special Effects Folder
- Rim Light intensity
- Accent Light intensity

### 4. Label Improvements

- Simplified parameter names (e.g., "Movement Amp" → "Amplitude")
- Consistent naming across similar parameters
- Removed redundant words in labels
- Made division selectors more concise

### 5. Performance Controls Organization

- Sphere performance toggle remains in Performance folder where it logically belongs
- Frustum culling toggle in Performance folder
- Performance metrics display in Performance folder

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization:** Related parameters are grouped together logically
2. **Easier Navigation:** Users can quickly find the type of control they need
3. **Reduced Clutter:** Parameters are organized into manageable subfolders
4. **Consistent Structure:** Similar types of controls follow the same organizational pattern
5. **Improved Workflow:** Users can focus on specific animation types without being overwhelmed by unrelated parameters

## Technical Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- Parameter bindings remain the same
- State management is unchanged
- MIDI mappings continue to work as before
- Scene import/export functionality is unaffected

The reorganization improves the user experience while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing scenes and presets.
