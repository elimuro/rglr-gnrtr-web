## Technical Details

### Supported Formats
The application automatically detects browser support for different video codecs and formats:

- **WebM (VP9)**: Best for web use, smaller file sizes, widely supported
- **WebM (VP8)**: Good compatibility, moderate file sizes
- **MP4 (H.264)**: Universal compatibility, larger file sizes (browser-dependent)
- **MP4**: Generic MP4 support (browser-dependent)

The system will automatically fall back to supported formats if your preferred choice isn't available.

### Quality Settings
- **Low**: 1 Mbps - Fast export, smaller files
- **Medium**: 3 Mbps - Balanced quality and size
- **High**: 5 Mbps - Best quality, larger files

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for WebM formats, limited MP4 support
- **Firefox**: Excellent WebM support, limited MP4 support
- **Safari**: Limited support (WebM recommended)
- **Mobile browsers**: Varies by device and browser version

## File Naming Convention
Recorded videos are automatically named with the pattern:
```
rglr-composition-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-sssZ.webm
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Recording uses browser's MediaRecorder API
- Memory usage scales with quality and duration
- Large files may take time to process

### Processing Time
- Higher quality settings require more processing
- 60 FPS recordings need more computational power
- Custom resolutions may impact performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Recording fails to start**
- Check browser permissions for media access
- Ensure canvas is visible and rendering
- Try refreshing the page

**Poor video quality**
- Increase quality setting in options
- Use higher frame rate for smoother motion
- Consider custom resolution for better quality

**Large file sizes**
- Use lower quality settings
- Reduce recording duration
- Choose WebM format for smaller files

**Browser compatibility**
- Use Chrome/Edge for best compatibility
- Firefox users should use WebM format
- Check the settings panel to see which formats your browser supports
- The system will automatically use the best available format

**Codec not supported error**
- This usually happens when trying to use MP4 format in browsers that don't support H.264
- The application will automatically fall back to WebM format
- Check the settings panel to see supported formats for your browser
- Safari users should use MP4 format

### Error Messages

**"Recording failed. Please try again."**
- Browser doesn't support MediaRecorder API
- Insufficient system resources
- Canvas not properly initialized

**"No video data recorded"**
- Recording duration too short
- Canvas not rendering during recording
- Browser permission issues

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Resolutions
1. Open settings panel
2. Select "Custom Size" in resolution dropdown
3. Set desired width and height
4. Apply settings and record

### Audio Recording
- Currently supports system audio if available
- Audio quality matches video quality
- Can be disabled in advanced settings

### Batch Recording
- Multiple recordings can be queued
- Each recording uses current settings
- Files are downloaded sequentially

## Integration with MIDI

The video recording system works seamlessly with MIDI controls:
- Record while using MIDI controllers
- MIDI parameter changes are captured in video
- Real-time parameter adjustments visible in recording

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future versions:
- **GIF Export**: Animated GIF creation
- **Screenshot Tool**: High-resolution still image capture
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple format export
- **Cloud Upload**: Direct upload to video platforms
- **Advanced Editing**: Basic video editing capabilities
